# project-Pencil
why Pencil? While I was starting this project there was a pencil on my side, so I just named the project Pencil. That's it.

Once I had to compress an image of my citizenship card,but I can't trust other sites.
So,I decided to create my own image compressor. Then I thought why not add
other features to it that mightbe useful to me.I added some features.

project-Pencil is a versatile web application that offers multiple useful features for users. 
It was initially created to address the need for a reliable image compressor but later included several other applications to make various tasks more convenient.<br>
The site is live here: https://propen.pythonanywhere.com/  <br>
But you can't use the features of YouTube because the freeplan of server on which the site is deployed won't support YouTube API. To use them you need to run the project on local server.


## Features

### 1) File Conversion

- **Supported Formats:** It can convert files and images from one format to another. It works with various formats like PDF, TXT, JPEG/JPG, PNG, and  EPUB.
  You can convert files from one format to another and download them.

### 2) Image Compressor

- **Outstanding Compression:** The image compressor in project-Pencil delivers outstanding results, ensuring that the compressed image remains virtually indistinguishable from the original.
  The differences in size will be enormous while the resulting quality will be indistinguishable. There are other sites that compress images but they are filled with ads. It's clean and smooth.
  I use this app in daily life and will continue to use it whenever there's a need.

### 3) YouTube Video Downloader

- **Any Resolution:** There are other sites where you can download YouTube videos by pasting a link, but almost all of them only allow to download up to 1080P.
  It's not some mediocre application that directly downloads the available video with audio integrated with it(which enables us to download 720P and 360P only).
  YouTube separates audio and video streams, so it downloads the audio and video separately and merges them using FFmpeg.
  Users can download YouTube videos by simply pasting the URL. It supports video downloads in any resolution, including 4K and 8K, providing more options than other sites.
  And the download speed will be superfast.

### 4) YouTube Audio Downloader

- **Download Audio:** This application allows users to download only the audio from YouTube videos, it was made primarily for downloading songs.
 It offers a superfast download rate without the slowdowns seen on other sites.

## Running the project on your local server:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sandarva3/project-Pencil.git`
2. Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt file above. Using pip `pip install -r requirements.txt` . While building this project, I experimented with a lot of packages and libraries.
   So there are some packages that aren't used on the project.
